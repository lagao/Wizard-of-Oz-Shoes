# Wizard-of-Oz-Shoes
Arduino code for in-sole device that plays address audio when shoe heel tapped 3 times.

## Background

A lost child is a parent's worst nightmare. Using the power of the cross-generational children story, Wizard of Oz, this device will both calm the child and alert bystanders of the situation.

## Hardware

The Wizard of Oz Shoe Device is comprised of a push button, a photocell, LED lights, and a speaker. Within the code, three activations of the push button within 3 seconds will trigger the photocell and speaker simultaneously. The photocell determines if it is day or night, and the LED lights will flicker as a result of the latter. The speaker will automatically play the Wizard of Oz theme song to soothe the child and announce the child's name, parent's name, home address, and parent's phone number to bystanders.

## Run Instructions

*This assumes your hardware is completely set up as described above.*
1. Make sure the Arduino IDE is installed.
2. Download the Dorothycode.ino file.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino.
4. Tap pushbutton on heel of shoe three times rapidly.
